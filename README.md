This repository contains code examples for using the openbadge analysis libraries. In addition, it contains documentation for some of the tests and evaluations that we have done for the badges.

To use the example, setup a Python 2.7 environment and install the required packages using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Folders:
* notebooks - analysis code examples, in the form of Jupyter notebooks
* data - data files for examples
